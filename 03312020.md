## Response to Examining the correlates and drivers of human population distributions across low- and middle-income countries by Nieves et al.

Nieves uses the random forest method to predict global population density. The random forest model is an ensemble method that take individual decision trees that by themselves are inadequate and combines them into stronger trees that increase performance on small and large datasets alike. The RF produces independent branches based on sets of covariates that serve as the ‘truck’ of the trees. Branches that stem from the initial data are trained to grow more trees, then random selections of variables are selected as best predictors and the cycle repeats until a stop criterion is met. Dasymmetric allocation is non-linear distribution of, in the case of this paper, persons to grid cells: meaning people are not evenly distributed in a grid cell thereby modeling real-world distribution that mirrors centers of population. There are several covariates that are used in modeling population density because they are indicators of human presence, they include: night-time lights, energy productivity of plants, topography and slope, climatic factors, type of land cover and presence/absence of roads, water features, human settlements and urban areas, protected areas and locations of points of interest, and facilities such as health centers and schools. When these variables are combined, they create accurate predictors of human population density.
