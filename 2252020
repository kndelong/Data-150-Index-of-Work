I feel like with massive troves of data, the scientific method cannot keep up with the brute force of petabytes of data being correlated and complied to indentify trends. The scientific method is simply too adrous of a process to keep up with the rapid development of technology in this century. While it is important to understand the causation of correlations; it is little more than an afterthough for modern data anaylsis techniques.
