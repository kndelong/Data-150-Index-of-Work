Random Forest models are a nonparametric modeling approach that grows a “forest” of individual classification or regression trees by using the best of a random selection of predictors at each node in each tree. Machine Learning is the application of artificial intelligence to programs that allow for the input of data of which uses to 'learn' and yield conclusions with little to know explicit programming. Modern learning techniques such as random forest compared to classical approaches allows for the incorporation of remotely sensed and geospatial data from multiple data sets with different scales to weigh into a high-resolution image with greater detail than older approaches. Steven highlights covariates such as land use/land cover, road and waterways, settlements and cities, facility locations, and census data; all of which are used to determine population density. The entire dataset represents a country or region divided into millions of grid cells. The significance of big data in the estimation of human population distribution includes pinpointing areas of interest allowing for expedited processes such as disaster relief delivered to high density population centers in times of need, thus avoiding loss of life. Having accurate data on where everyone is located on earth allows for swift deliverance of aid as mentioned above, indications of mass loss of life such as war or genocide (for identifying regions that may be in need foreign intervention), and predicting and preventing the transmission of diseases. In regards to my area of investigation (standards of living in Russia), it is helpful to know where people reside and their proximity to hospitals and other infrastructure that support the way they live.
