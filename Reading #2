## "What is Human Development?" & "The Best Stats You’ve Never Seen"

What are some of the targetted issues that Jahan examples as requiring focus throughout the world? Elaborate further on Jahan’s definition of human development. What are the different measures incorporated into the Human Development Index that serve to capture the breadth and focus of each countries’ average achievement?

In the podcast, Jahan describes human developement as "the enlargement of human choices." He states that human developement should enlarge choices in every aspect of life; there are two sides the capabilites olf people need to be enhanced and the opportunities of human beings need to be enhanced to use the capabilities. The two sides of Jahan's definitions mean that human developement is more that a one sided problem. Human developement reqires the understanding that for chocies to be enhanced, persons have to be empowered to use the tools they are being provided; i.e. populations cannot go from having nothing to something withoput the education to put systemns in to place that continue the growth and development of their countries. It's like the classic saying "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you will feed him for a lifetime." Jahan also talks about how devlopement of the people, for the people, by the people; meaning human capital is cultivated for helping others and people are not only receiving but are active in the developlement. 
"The Human Developement Index a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living." ([United Nations HDR](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi))
