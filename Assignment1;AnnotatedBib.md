#### Introduction

The purpose of this annotated bibliography is to consolidate sources that reflect a relationship between foundational infrastructure and its impact on living standards. The Russian Federation is far from being a low-middle income country; but it still faces the same inherent issues as LMICs. Where Russia differs from LMICs is localized regions within the country that experience different natures of hardship, thus a universal or average solution does not work. The complexity to identifying every area within a country where problems facing human development exist is prevalent in every nation in the world. It is within human nature to perpetually create threats to human capabilities, combined with natural disasters and other systemic issues; a complete solution can never be found. The Russian Federation is an interesting topic in that Western biases towards the Russian Federation are also damaging because more often than not their institutions are given less credit than they deserve. Connecting the sources to identify related processes to aid in the standardizations of living standard within Russia is a complicated task. The information in each of the sources is useful in determining the correlation and causation between economic and social issues and their influence on the continuation of development in Russia, but identification of problems does not instantaneously guarantee a solution to the challenges presented. The importance of marketing responsible industry, innovation, and infrastructure as it pertains to the challenges identified while maintaining a balance between social burdens, economic hardships, and health related crises.

The article explores the importance of preserving territorial integrity of the country by attracting and retaining top-tier residents; this amplifies the capabilities of people to raise revenue in their respective regions thus providing a higher quality of life to local residents. The rapid movements of persons within the Federal Regions reduces the competitiveness of their respective regions thus negatively influencing the standard of living and participation in the local community. To develop the territories' social responsibility to their residence as to increase the living standard whilst maintaining labor efficiency. An increase in industry, innovation, and infrastructure to support the positive migration of new skilled labor as part of regional marketing plans thus makes it possible to sustain a higher level of satisfaction between current and new residents. The author uses a local human development index and a global completive index to graphically compare and recognize patterns within the data as it pertains to the increase in the regional efficiency of production and the level of development of human capital. This is achieved by territorial marketing strategies to provide a high quality of life to local residents. The author poses the question as: how does territorial marketing to the increase in the standards of living. The flow of human resources out of districts negatively impacts the efficiency of human capital in respective regions thus reducing the quality of life in those regions. The problem is a balancing act between attracting skilled individuals to contribute to local markets whilst having flow of human capital around the country to ensure that all regions grow at similar rates. The solution to this is unknown, but this would result in the growth of the country as a whole. Significant inability to retain an effective workforce dampens the innovation and construction of infrastructure; this reduces the advancement in human development across the board.

Infrastructure is a set of industries and activities that provide adequate conditions in which an area of a country or region can move in a forward direction. The finding of the research includes: investments into fixed capital, resource mining, consumer sectors and volume of savings within the population. The elements influence both the social and economic development of regions; therefore, the theme of attracting an increase in infrastructure investments create conditions that favorable for the development of business and satisfaction of population needs. With these increases come the enhancement of human capability to move into a newer modern state that brings a higher standard of living. Investment into the improvement of industry multiplied each dollar invested into 1.59 effective dollars; thus, improving existing infrastructures, reduction of transport and communication costs, power and water supply expenses, and also private investments. The authors use the following datasets to model their findings using panel regression and cluster analysis methods: "Indicators of economic infrastructure: a) density of rails, km. per 10000 sq. m. of area; b) density of roads with a hard coating, km per 1000 sq. m. of area; c) transport loads turnover, mln. tons per km. per capita; d) production and distribution of electric power and gas and water per capita, in rubles, e) volume of communication service per capita, in rubles. Indicators of financial infrastructure: а) deposits of legal entities and individuals in the credit organizations per capita in rubles (dep); b) deposits of legal entities and individuals in the credit organizations in foreign currency per capita in rubles (dep); c) fixed investments per capita in rubles (cap); d) foreign direct investments per capita in USD. Indicators of social infrastructure: а) turnover of retail per capita, in rubles; b) public catering turnover per capita, in rubles (ctr); c) number of hospital beds per 10 000 inhabitants (hbd); d) number of out-patient and hospital organizations per capita; e) number of universities and colleges per capita. Indicators of the real sector of economy: а) oil and gas mining per capita, in rubles (extr); b) the volume of building constructive works, in rubles; c) the volume of agriculture production per capita, in rubles; d) number of occupied persons in economy in thousands of people" (Serkova, Ignatyeva, Mariev, Lee, 2018). The authors asked the question "Do infrastructure factors influence social and economic development of Russian regions"; The research using the data mentioned previously proves economic, social, and financial infrastructures influence the social and economic development of Russian regions. Thus, the analysis conducted allowed the identification of regions with challenges. Essentially, the paper tells us that Russia has to change their strategy of the infrastructural development of regions to avoid entrapment; otherwise, their national economy will not be able to grow further. The significate time investment of modernizing Russian infrastructure will trouble the nation for years to come.

What caused the Russian Mortality Crisis? When Russia transitioned from a command economy to a market, the prices of goods and services, and privatization of factories and capital goods experienced hyperinflation between the years of 1992-94 which led to an increase in prices by 633 times. With this, the population was not protected and experienced a drop in average real income. But it is hard to conclude whether or not this resulted in a sudden increase in mortality. The author uses graphs, linage analysis, and survival analysis to determine trends in mortality rates. During this time the standard of living in Russia was much higher than other developing or communist countries. With Russia's health care budget being based on what the author calls 'the principle of leftovers' this led to the overall weakness of the health care system in the long-term breakdown of health in Russia. The concept of mass psychological stress associated with the unexpected and rapid breakdown of the Soviet system left people in a state of uncertainty that made it difficult to strategies how to survive in the post-Soviet era. Drastic changes in the labor market led to mechanisms causing Russians of working age to increase in their pattern of dangerous consumption of alcohol thus leading to the apparent increase in the mortality rate. With the decrease in the average life expectancy of the population, the freedoms enjoyed are limited by uncertainties of the labor market and the amount of choices facing individual. The rise in the abusive use of alcohol in Russia is one of the many social problems in Russia that prohibit further modernization. The decline in life expectancy of persons in Russia indicates the degradation of the standard of living that developed from the socioeconomic and psychological strain that was caused by the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The external challenges face by the Russia Federation, such as the fall of oil prices and sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union, have caused the reduction of budgetary expenditure in Russia. This leads to a problem which requires the state to reduce budgetary expenditure while maintaining or improving the accessibility of public services. The study used a variety of analytical methods such as "methods of system and statistical analysis, analogies, comparative analysis, monographic research, graphical method, and others" (Danilina, Gaifutdinova, Kuznetsof, 2015). In the study, the authors state that the Russian Federation has had a clear increasing trend in public spending; however, they noted that actual situation differs greatly from what is evaluated thus leading to the increase in spending to support the well-being of the population. The increase in budget spending on the social burden severely strains the Federation's government to provide for its populous, thereby having to make a decision between supporting the economy or public sector employees. Overall, the without the subsidization of public employees’ salaries the strain on supporting themselves and their families would increase the social burden. A decrease in overall social spending is needed to support the development of the country, but there are choices to be made in the optimization of expenditure. The current social burden on the Russian Federation is detrimental to the progression of modernization and development, there is a desperate need for fiscal consolidation in order to decrease the public deficit while ensuring the integrity of the well-being of citizens.

Fluctuations of poverty are reflected by the economic upheavals in the Russian economy. Regional differences reflect different standards of living; thus, a universal method cannot be applied to assess the country in its entirety. This relates to the definition of human development in that the wellbeing of Russian citizens directly impacts their ability to have total freedom. The study conducted strived to understand variations in poverty across the Russian Federal Regions in terms of their differences, i.e. income per capita, inequality, and price levels using decomposition analysis and cooperative game theory with aggregate macroeconomic data, household survey data, and micro census. Disparities found between regions prevent the development of Russian society from further developing, and some regions also undergo a reversal of positive efforts. Persons living in regions below subsistence level are not afforded the same opportunities that persons from richer regions might have, thus leading to the need of equality across the Russian Federation. The identification of poverty in localized areas is a powerful tool for establishing infrastructure in afflicted areas to greatly aid in the modernization and expansion of human capability in Russia.

#### Summary

Across all five sources, there is a collection of information that details issues that pertain to the state of human development in Russia. The common factor in each of these published peices can be utilized in conjunction with one another to develop a sense of the conditions in the Russian Federation. The regional marketing of infrastucture can be used to develop an idea of how to identify, interpret, and postulate how to deal with the issues concerning mortality, economic policy, and poverty. There is not one correct answer of how to address these issues, nor are any of these issues unique to Russia.
