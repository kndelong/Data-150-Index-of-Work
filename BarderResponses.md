What is the significane of Schumpeter's idea of creative destruction?

How does it relate to firms and industries?
What is co-evolution and why is it significant?




Creative destruction harks back to the idea of survival of the fittest. His idea is that old firms lack the ability to develop new technologies and eventually bust. Then they are replaced with new innovative firms which are better adapted to the current market.

Co-evolution is the complex adaptive system of the economy that cycles based on the environment facing it. These cycles indicate that there is no equilibrium towards which the entire economy is moving. 



How successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?



The hunt for an accurate model has led to a "fruitless quest for the missing ingredient which will enable poor countries to grow". Every model which he made reference to he called "stupid". The 4 bullet points of development in the last 50 years 

- Fastest progress in history

- No explanation for the difference

- Missing ingredients?

- All endogenous

Some countries experience exponential growth and even countries that haven't made large improvements in human welfare. Traditional models also have a hard time explaining how some countries experience rapid growth and others do not. None of efforts to find the missing engredient have worked. Looking at something to be improved from the outside turns out to be a characteristic of the system within itself.
