## "What is Human Development?" & "The Best Stats You’ve Never Seen"

Fishing is the key to Human Development. It's like the classic saying "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you will feed him for a lifetime." Selim Jahan describes human development as "the enlargement of human choices." He states that human development should enlarge choices in every aspect of life; there are two sides, the capabilities of people need to be enhanced and the opportunities of human beings need to be enhanced to use the capabilities. Human development requires the understanding that for choices to be enhanced, persons have to be empowered to use the tools they are being provided; i.e. learning how to fish.

Hans Rosling stated that countries are moving at the same rate as money and health. He mentions that countries can move faster if they are healthier, to show this he uses the United Arab Emirates as an example. The UAE became a fisherman when they became an oil exporter. With the sale of oil came large amounts of capital, of which Sheikh Zayed invested in a health support system for his country. The creation of capital is learning to fish, and the fish are capital to continue the growth and development of a country. Development is of the people, for the people, by the people; meaning people are taught to fish, and not only receive but are active participants in continuing growth. 

"The Human Development Index a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living." ([United Nations HDR](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi)) In the HDI there are two measures: Breadth and Focus. The Breadth measure is more comprehensive in detail and covers statistics such as mortality rates, unemployment, etc. The Focus measure covers the details that make up the front of the HDI; life expectance, knowledge, and standards of living. Jahan used a metaphor to describe the two; the Breadth is a house, and Focus is the door, he said “don’t mistake the door for the house, and don’t stop at the door.” Much like mistaking a door for a house, Rosling touches on how looking at averages’ skews data. An average will skew data to represent something in the middle, but when the scale of the data is split into subdivisions it reveals that there are multi-faceted issues in complete opposite sides of the data. The result illustrates that universal plans miss their intended targets; because blanket solutions seldom solve vast disparities of issues in localized regions as compared to entire countries or continents. Thus, returning to Jahan’s point of how the HDI does cannot cover the totality of human development. By teaching individuals how to fish, they then possess the tools to diversify and expand development in their countries and around the globe.
