# Assignment 2: Literature review
Development means freedom. In the words of Amartya Sen, Human Development is the process of expanding freedom, “the enhancement of freedoms that allow people to have a reason to live”. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia underwent transformations that changed if from a communist dictatorship to a multiparty democracy. The Russian Federation started in the early 1990s as a middle-income country with a GDP per capita of $8,000 USD, this is roughly the same as modern day Mexico. Standard of living is measured using the GDP per capita of a country. In the case of Russia, these statistics are greatly exaggerated at the beginning of the 1990s due to recorded GDP in the Soviet Union consisting of military goods, cheap consumer products with no demand, and unfinished construction projects. (Shleifer & Treisman, 2005) A countries standard of living measured based on GDP neglects disparities within social classes: the diverse nature of regions in the Russian Federation means that each one experiences hardships in different ways. A blanket solution to identify these problems is not sufficient enough to truly enhance the freedoms of Russia citizens. Indicators such as mortality rates, causes of death, investment, foundational infrastructure, agriculture and supply chains, affordability of housing, transportation networks and interconnectedness in conjunction with one another would serve to derive living standards for a diverse population of people. A methodology that can use a multitude of indicators and derive relationships between them is a powerful tool that can be fine-tuned and adjusted to best suit the needs for the progression of human development in many countries around the world.
	
  More often than not, Russian institutions are given less credit than they deserve. This is due to the anti-communist sentiments that reigned throughout the Western world through better half of the 20th century. Biases towards Russia harm possible progression towards the continuation of human development: limiting aid due to ideological differences proves detrimental for the progression of all humankind. It is not possible to quantify these sentiments thus making seem like a near impossible task. The removal of human judgement would perhaps limit the amount bias that can sway decisions such as what regions or communities receive aid before another during times of crisis. With the combination of human indicators and deep learning processes, unbiased, life-saving decisions can be made. More meaningful connections between data and covariates can be made using computers versus human decision.
	
  At a fundamental level the understanding of agricultural systems that support populations is the greatest determinate of human development and success. The founding and flourishing of Mesopotamia would not have been possible without a stable food supply. Agriculture in Russia is a large portion of development in agrarian territories, and serves as the main source of employment/income for residents. (Pavlov & Karmyshova, 2015) On the basis of improving the quality of existing foundations in conjunction with the establishment of new processes in rural areas this development could jumpstart relatively poor regions. This does not mean transferring resources from other sections of the economy, rather inviting opportunity for investment and incentives to retain residents. (Volkov, 2015) In growing the sustainability of agriculture in developing areas certain processes have to work in harmony with one another: maintenance of arable land for the long run, reduction of ecological pollutants, microeconomic existence of possibilities for agricultural enterprise, along with being able to meet the global demand of the market and ensure competitiveness in foreign markets for a sustainable macroeconomic possibilities. (Pavlov & Karmyshova, 2015) These processes improve the standards of living for rural populations, thus giving them avenues for investment and the diversification of choices. Infrastructure is defined as a set of industries and activities that provide adequate conditions in which countries or regions can move forwards. This ultimately limited by the number of people it can comfortably support. Covariates gathered from agriculture and infrastructure start the foundation of a deep learning method that can be used to accurately depict disparities in standards of living across countries, regions, and localized areas. The identification of these indicators is the first step in establishing a machine process.
	
  Building from agricultural processes and infrastructure we arrive at transportation networks and how they support the movement of people across territories in support of a national structure of infrastructure. In the evolution from a command economy to an open market, it is critical that Russia can reallocate resources from inefficient Soviet enterprises to new sectors. Inherently, Russia has a geographically concentrated industrial structure. Many towns and regions rely on single industry or even single enterprise. (Andrienko & Guriev, 2004) The lack of market infrastructure and corporate governance limit the mobility of capital throughout the country. Being able to efficiently move labor is essential for restructuring the country that utilizes the full potential of a market economy. Interregional differences in real income, wages, and unemployment rates are very large: these indicators are not decreasing either. Vast disparities between regions and the lack of convergence in the workforce indicate people do not relocate from impoverished areas thus giving the impression that certain regions are stuck in a poverty trap. (Andrienko & Guriev, 2004) During capitalist reforms from 1992-2012 characterized a decline in the living standard of a majority of the population. Inadequate spending on social protections for low-income persons is expanding the gap between persons in the Russian Federation. (Shkolnikov, Cornia, Leon & Meslé, 1998) Russia spends 10-13% of its total GDP on social protections; two times lower than the UK, Germany, Italy, and France. (Bobkov & Veredyuk, 2013) Underfunding and non-targeted social protections contribute to the large disparities in social classes. This suboptimal system indicates a need for a plan process to establish efficient systems for citizens to seek aid. The Russian Federation is struggles to maintain a stead economy in the wake of falling oil prices and sanctions from the west. These problems have forced the government to shift support from the economy towards working individuals. Without the subsidization of salaries, more people would be forced into poverty. (Danilina, Gaifutdinova & Kuznetsof, 2015) The establishment of clear social infrastructure that can support citizens at a subsistence level and eventually evolve to bring people of out poverty is necessity. A model to provide a geographical reference for the identification for people in need.
	
  Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russia Federation has been struggling with a health and mortality crisis that revolves around alcohol abuse. The transition of the Russia from a command to an open market, the fluctuation of goods and services, and the privatization of factories and capital goods hyperinflated their economy which led to a price increase of 633 percent in the year 1992-94. (Shkolnikov, Cornia, Leon & Meslé, 1998) The lack of social protections led to the population experiencing an incredible drop in real income for families. The thought of medical care in Russia is somewhat of an afterthought. The financial crisis as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union left people with a psychological strain due to a continual state of uncertainty that made survival difficult. Changes in the labor market triggered coping mechanisms in many working age Russians to increase their consumption of alcohol to dangerous levels. (Shkolnikov, Cornia, Leon & Meslé, 1998) Research into morality rates was forbidden in the Soviet Union as it would have exposed social inequalities between people of different ethnicities and gender. Recent studies illustrated a clear trend of improvement in life expectancy of persons with higher education. (Shkolnikov, Leon, Adamets, Andreev & Deev, 1998) These psychological problems are not geographically linked to any one particular region. Among the people afflicted alcoholism, it is up to individuals to self-report thus creating an accurate dataset on the number of people an impossibility. However, a work around for this statistical shortcoming would be to use mortality data that incorporates cause of death and use the proportion of those that died from alcohol related complications in further studies.
	
  The importance of finding indicators that are yield conclusive results is very important. Features such as agriculture, physical infrastructure such as cities and hospitals, geological features, and transport networks (railways and roads) can be used as fundamental indicators and covariates due their physical existence. Population density is another important factor to consider. In knowing the population of areas, estimations on travel time to hospitals, proximity to central transportation hubs as access to commerce for food and other necessities can be made. The distinction between large urbanized areas and agrarian communities also becomes more recognizable. Using a machine learning method to identify deeper trends and relationships that are not apparent on a surface level analysis is important. It is incredibly taxing to create a model that incorporates every variable, and it may even be an impossible task. There are also agents if development in play that do not directly correlate to identifying standards of living, however the identification of those agents that may impact social atmospheres is also powerful. An analysis on public sentiment is a way to allow for the monitoring the success of implemented programs. For example, if an agricultural jumpstart program is introduced and is found to be unsuccessful, an analysis of public sentiment towards the program can give an indication towards failure points such as the program not being well received by residents. A survey of public sentiments can also provide an outlet for citizens to voice their discomforts about certain actions that may or may not positively impact their wellbeing. 
	
  The sources referenced in this paper use older linear regression-based models on which their findings where produced. In more modern times we have access to a large increase in computing power that would allow for the incorporation of gigantic datasets capable of incorporating a larger number of variables that can be used to create more accurate predictions. Neural Networks are biologically-inspired programming paradigm in which a computer learns from observational data. Neural nets consist of processing nodes that are interconnected much like brain neurons. The nets are organized into layered nodes that feed data through, meaning individual nodes are connected to several nodes below from which it receives data then sends data to the layer above it until and repeats until end criterion is met. Each node assigns a weight number, when a node receives a data assignment it multiplies the data by the associated weight of the node. To pass to the next layer, the number must exceed a threshold value thus sending the data to the next node. At the beginning the network’s weights are all assigned random initial values. The network is then trained to yield an output that is radically different from the input. Throughout the training cycle weight and threshold values are adjusted to consistently produce similar results. 
	
  When data associated with measuring standard of living across a representative geographical area is run through a neural network a set of new found connections is received as the output. Input data such as population density, health data, investments, infrastructural indicators, supply chains, housing market data, transport networks, points of interest inputted into a network trained to identify linking trends, a powerful tool for locating target areas for social programs, infrastructure development projects, and revitalization projects is developed.
	
  In summary, the identification of reliable indicators of criteria is of the utmost importance. While some datasets can be directly linked to a geospatial area, others such as sentiment and psychological issues, cannot be directly addressed. There will never be a catch all solution for accurately measuring the standard of living amongst populations with millions of persons. Taking the analysis out of human hands and placing the numbers in a deep learning method such as a neural network can could be able to accurately predict a better distributed picture of living standards within Russia. By removing human analysis of trends and creating a better computer-based methodology, it creates the possibility to incorporate larger loosely related datasets into solutions that can more accurately depict the reality of a physical situation.
